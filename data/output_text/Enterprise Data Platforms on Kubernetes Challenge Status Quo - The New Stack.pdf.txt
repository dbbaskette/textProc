Software as a Service (SaaS) data platforms have enjoyed significant adoption over
the last few years. Growth has been driven by the perceived benefits of low
management overhead, compelling user experience and faster time to business
value.

However, as with all technologies, there are trade-offs that should be considered
when deciding if a SaaS deployment model is right for your company. Letʼs explore
the pros and cons of SaaS-based data platforms and dive deep into how Kubernetes
is emerging as an alternative deployment option for a new breed of data platforms.

Will SaaS Eat the World?

Over the past few years, the data and analytics world has been obsessed with
delivering and consuming SaaS offerings, and the market has been dominated by
Snowflake and Databricks. Both offer public cloud-only SaaS platforms for building
solutions for use cases such as data warehousing, data integration and preparation,
and business intelligence and AI/machine learning.

The ease of consumption, on-demand elasticity and the broad set of features that
these services offer have fueled its popularity. Much of the growth has been at the
expense of legacy technologies from Teradata, Cloudera, Vertica, Oracle and others
that have been unable to replicate the public cloud experience these vendors offer.

However, SaaS platforms such as these are not without challenges. They offer a
one-size-fits-all model to deliver economies of scale. SaaS providers play a
delicately balanced margin-stacking game. They buy compute capacity from a
public cloud service provider (CSP), and then build software, operations, resiliency
and support services on top.

Excess compute capacity is also procured and maintained to deliver rapid expansion
capabilities. Turning a profit requires that many customers consume data in the
same way, in the same regions, with little customization. Hence, all users of the
SaaS data platform have the same experience, the same security controls and
defaults, and the same limitations regarding how and where their data is stored and
managed.

When an organization signs up to use a SaaS data platform, it is handing over its
data to the SaaS vendor to manage on its behalf. Basically, an organization is ceding
control of the companyʼs data to a third party and, in turn, paying the vendor to
access it. This lack of control over how and where data is managed is troubling for
many CIOs and CISOs, particularly those in the federal government sector and
companies subject to data sovereignty regulations.

vendors.

Of concern is the lack of on-premises and hybrid cloud offerings to complement the
SaaS vendorsʼ public cloud platforms. To address data security and sovereignty
issues, new data platforms are emerging that leverage the elasticity, resilience and
portability of Kubernetes and provide a SaaS-like user experience within an
organizationʼs own data center or CSP account.

DIY Data and Analytics on Kubernetes

Kubernetes has been successful in supporting scale-out stateless web services. Its
elasticity, resilience and extensibility make it an excellent choice as the
orchestration platform for containerized web application fleets.

Equally important is the emergence of managed Kubernetes offerings from AWS,
Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform in the form of Elastic Kubernetes
Service (EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Google Kubernetes Engine
(GKE). They allow developers to focus on application development and leave the
task of managing Kubernetes to cloud providers.

In addition, Kubernetes can be used to support scale-out stateful database
platforms, particularly those in data warehousing and analytics. Using Kubernetes
operators, a SQL-based data platform becomes a Kubernetes application that offers
the extensibility, resiliency, automation and portability of Kubernetes to deliver a
data warehousing solution that can scale efficiently and run anywhere.

Kubernetes allows organizations to run data warehousing in any public cloud using
managed offerings from cloud providers. It also allows them to run workloads on
premises through enterprise offerings such as Red Hat OpenShift running on Dell
hardware.

Running a data platform within the physical walls of a data center, or within the
logical confines of a virtual private cloud, enables an organization to maintain
ownership of its data and still have access to all the characteristics and features that
made SaaS data platforms popular in the first place.

But here is the critical point: There are fewer data sovereignty and security issues as
the data and processes that manage the data are fully owned and run by the
organization, rather than the SaaS vendor.

By running the data platform stack on Kubernetes in a company-owned cloud
account or data center, organizations are free to tailor the authentication,
authorization and networking configuration to suit their own information security
policies. There are no one-size-fits-all requirements, as with SaaS data platforms.
Also, because SaaS providers aim to maximize profits and minimize costs,
geographic regions are limited to those in which they operate, meaning that certain
companies cannot use them. With Kubernetes, if the public cloud provider does not
exist within a given region, a company can still deploy data warehousing workloads
in its own data center and maintain a cloud-like experience in terms of elasticity. An
organization can also create hybrid and multicloud deployments of a Kubernetes-
based data platform depending on data locality, residency or governance needs.

Large enterprises can also take advantage of discount plans already negotiated with
CSPs by running a data platform on Kubernetes managed by cloud providers. In
contrast, if an organization signs up with a SaaS provider such as Snowflake or
BigQuery, they cannot do this and are forced to swallow the higher consumption
prices that result from the stack of margins the SaaS vendors and the CSPs below
them are forced to maintain to realize a profit.

Data on Kubernetes on Steroids

By natively integrating the data platform as a first-class Kubernetes application,
customers can host and run a SaaS-like data platform for its own users. However,
some may have a concern about the knowledge gap between Kubernetes and the
data platform itself. Why should a business analyst or data scientist care about the
internal workings of Kubernetes when they just want to analyze data?

One solution is to ensure that the details of Kubernetes are abstracted away from
end users by deploying a data platform that has a SQL interface over Kubernetes.
This simplifies provisioning and managing compute resources without having to

worry about kubectl, custom resource definitions or Helm charts. Implementing this
type of solution with an intuitive installation experience and without requiring
Kubernetes expertise enables users to install and run a data platform in their own
cloud account in just a matter of minutes. With this approach, it is highly possible
that an organization can become a SaaS data platform provider in just under half an
hour.
