	AWS S3 Backend


  

AWS S3 Backend


Spring Cloud Config Server supports AWS S3 as a backend for configuration properties.
You can enable this feature by adding a dependency to the AWS Java SDK For Amazon S3.




pom.xml


<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
		<artifactId>s3</artifactId>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>






The following configuration uses the AWS S3 client to access configuration files. We can use spring.cloud.config.server.awss3.* properties to select the bucket where your configuration is stored.





spring:
  profiles:
    active: awss3
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        awss3:
          region: us-east-1
          bucket: bucket1






It is also possible to specify an AWS URL to override the standard endpoint of your S3 service with spring.cloud.config.server.awss3.endpoint. This allows support for beta regions of S3, and other S3 compatible storage APIs.




Credentials are found using the Default Credential Provider Chain. Versioned and encrypted buckets are supported without further configuration.




Configuration files are stored in your bucket as {application}-{profile}.properties, {application}-{profile}.yml or {application}-{profile}.json. An optional label can be provided to specify a directory path to the file.




	

	
When no profile is specified default will be used.
